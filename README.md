# transparent

Version: 2022-10-27 v1.5

transparent package for LaTeX

pdfTeX and luatex supports several color stacks. This
package shows, how a separate color stack can be used for transparency,
a property besides color, that works across page breaks.

If the PDF management is used it can also be used with other engines 
but without support for page breaks.
